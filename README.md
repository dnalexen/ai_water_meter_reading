The objective of this project was to design an algorithm to read the exact consumption index from a valid picture of a meter. 

We used an implementation of the YOLOv4 algorithm that we customed to our dataset.

The model is live on a web app: https://dash-app-meter-reading.onrender.com/.

The dataset is available at: https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/30.

In the notebook meter-reading-YOLOv4-Roboflow-PyTorch.ipynb, you will find the code explained.
