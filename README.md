The objective of this project is to design an algorithm to read the exact consumption index from a valid picture of a meter. 
We used an implementation of the YOLOv4 algorithm that we customed to our dataset. 
The model is live on a web app: https://ai-water-meter-reading.herokuapp.com/
In the notebook meter-reading-YOLOv4-Roboflow-PyTorch.ipynb, you will find the code explained.
