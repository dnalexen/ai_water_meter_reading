# ai_water_meter_reading
Project on an algorithm to read automatically the water consumption with an image of a meter
The objective of this project is to design an algorithm to read the exact consumption index from a valid picture of a meter. We used an implementation of the YOLOv4 algorithm that we customed to our dataset. The model is live on a web app. You can have a look on the code on the projectâ€™s Github Repository.
